# KMS

I am done with configuring modesetting for our graphic card. Lets move to our bootloader with is GRUB2
Bootloader

My default bootloader is grub2, I am going to edit /etc/default/grub

I have to tell grub our default screen resolution, on booting, modules and drivers are not loaded yet. I can fetch our screen resolution by typing:
01
	
$ xdpyinfo | grep dimensions
01
	
dimensions:    1366x768 pixels (361x203 millimeters)

Here my resolution is 1366Ã—768. I am going to find the line #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 in /etc/default/grub , uncomment the line and add in my resolution. Making it
01
	
GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768

Search for this line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet" and change it to:
01
	
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

Finally, update my grub configuration
01
	
$ sudo update-grub2
